    <h2>Graphical View</h2>
    <h3>Overlay</h3>
    You can set overlays for each level within the settings window. This can then be toggled from the toolbar. Do make sure to load a new game first!
    <h3>Tileset</h3>
    A universal tileset can also be set through the settings window. Simply create a file with the following syntax:<br>

    <code>
        &lt;low1&gt; &lt;high1&gt; &lt;file1&gt; <br>
        &lt;low2&gt; &lt;high2&gt; &lt;file2&gt; <br>
        ...
    </code><br>

    And point to it on the settings window. It can then be toggled from the toolbar in the GUI.

    <h3>Zoom</h3>
    Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd> to zoom in on the GUI and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> to zoom out.
